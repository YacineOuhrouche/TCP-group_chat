The TCP Group Chat Application is a multi-user messaging system built using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for reliable, ordered communication between clients and a server. This application allows multiple users to join a chat room, send and receive messages in real time, and ensure that all participants are updated with the latest messages. The system leverages TCPâ€™s connection-oriented nature to guarantee message delivery without loss, making it suitable for group chat environments where reliability is crucial.
